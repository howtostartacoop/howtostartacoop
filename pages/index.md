# How to Start a Coop

This site is dedicated to helping you start your a cooperative. Our information is compiled from a variety of sources including the [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/), [the Center for Cooperatives](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/), [the Sustainable Economies Law Center](https://www.theselc.org/), and the [Cooperative Development Foundation](https://www.cdf.coop/). One major resource we relied heavily on is *Steps to Starting a Worker Co-op* by Gary Hansen. We have tried our best to make the process as simple as possible.
