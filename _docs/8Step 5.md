# **Draft legal papers and secure membership and financial commitments**.
In this step we will clarify organizational issues and prepare the legal papers needed for incorporation. Secure the members' written and financial commit­ments.

## Guidelines
To protect yourself legally, consult an attorney experienced with worker cooperatives to as­sist with this step.

## **Select a Name**
To conduct business and in­ corporate, the co-op must have a name. In­ cluding the word "cooperative" or "co-op" in the name reminds members and the public that it is a worker-owned business. Some states require that "cooperative" or "worker co-op" be included in the name to legally organize it as a co-op.

## **Prepare Bylaws**
Although it is important that bylaws reflect the specific issues and needs unique to your cooperative, obtain bylaws from other worker cooperatives in your state for gUidance. The references that follow this step contain sample bylaws.
- The bylaws, or fundamental rules of the co­ op, provide legal guidance for operating the co-op. Because changing bylaws can be a difficult process, each bylaw should be pre­sented as a general statement that will re­ main consistent over time. Guided by the bylaws, the co-op will eventually need to establish policies and operating procedures that are more specific. The general areas covered in the bylaws include specifying who is eligible for membership; the param­eters of member employment (e.g., defin­ing the probationary period for member­ ship, whether work is full- or part-time), identifying the capital contributions mem­bers must make, and how payroll or other distributions will be made; defining how the net income or losses of the cooperative will be distributed; identifying how deci­sions are made; the roles and responsibilities­ ties of the board of directors and officers and how the board is to be selected (if ap­plicable); how membership and board meetings will be conducted; how the co­ operative will be managed; expectations for ongoing education and training; and how bylaws can be changed.
- Establish plans for mediating conflict be­ tween managers and worker-members that balance power and authority with account­ ability.
- Proposed bylaws must be thoroughly dis­ cussed among prospective members (and modified where necessary) before adoption.

## **Design a Membership Agreement**
The membership agreement specifies the rights and obligations of membership. It is an important document that should be created with the in­ put of organizers, prospective members, and legal counsel.

## **Decide How to Incorporate the Business**
A co-op is strongly encouraged to incorporate because incorporation limits individual mem­bers' liability, provides a legal entity for busi­ness transactions, allows enforcement of by­ laws and membership agreements, and may provide tax advantages. The business can be incorporated as a worker co-op in states with worker co-op statutes (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massa­chusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington) that have adopted the Massachusetts Model Act. Many states have general cooperative stat­utes designed for consumer cooperatives that may be used by worker cooperatives. Addi­tional options for incorporation can include using your state's general business-corporation statute or the foreign-incorporation provision of the worker-cooperative acts. Incorporating under any statute not specifically designed for a worker cooperative in your state may be problematic, so evaluate the best way to in­ corporate with the guidance of an attorney ex­perienced with worker cooperatives.

## **Prepare Articles of Incorporation**
The ar­ticles of incorporation are the founding legal documents that give the corporation its legal existence.
- The articles should set forth the cooperative's name, address, duration, and purpose; how membership works; what capital is required of members; what hap­ pens to the cooperative's assets upon dis­ solution; and other information required by state regulations.
- Articles should be general (more general than bylaws) so that they are as flexible as state statutes allow. The articles take prece­dence over bylaws, and bylaws cannot con­tradict what is stated in the articles.
- The proposed articles of incorporation should be discussed with prospective members, reviewed by an attorney familiar with worker cooperatives, and filed with the Sec­retary of States office, although specific regulations vary by state. If the articles sat­isfy the statutory requirements and the fees and taxes are paid, the Secretary of State will issue a certificate of incorporation that creates the cooperative.

## **Secure Membership Commitments**
- Prospective members become members when they sign the approved membership agreement and follow through on its pre­liminary conditions, making an initial capi­tal contribution.
- Depending on the amount of the capital contribution required, it may be necessary to obtain a loan from a credit union or other lender for the members. Members payoff the loan in installments or through payroll deductions once the enterprise is opera­tional.
- Additional canvassing may be needed for prospective members who want more time to think about joining or those unable to attend the meeting.
