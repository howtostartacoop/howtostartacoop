# **Collect Information, Clarify Needs, and Assemble Organizing Group**
In this step we will collect basic information about worker cooperatives and assemble an organizing group. This step lays the groundwork for the group to make an informed decision about whether to start a worker co-op.

## **Guidelines**
The organizing group should consist of po­tential member-owners of the cooperative. The number of people who can participate most effectively is 5 to 15. One or two members would be inadequate because of the amount of work to be accomplished, and more than 15 could make the initial group unwieldy and unproductive. The organizing group should be prepared to devote substantial time to com­plete necessary research, attend weekly or bi­weekly meetings, and participate in commit­tee work.

## **Collect materials, facts, and data.**
- Gather information about how worker co­ ops operate, and review the legal require­ments and internal capital account struc­tures needed to organize this type of busi­ness.
- Collect information about starting a busi­ness.
- Conduct preliminary research about your business idea to help identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as potential obstacles and problems.

## **Identify people who might share an inter­est in the coop.**
- Share information about developing a co­op and assess interest.
- Identify and discuss mutual needs and how a coop could address them.

## **Inventory the skills and experiences of people in the organizing group.**
- Assess which skills and experience exist within the group and which need to be acquired through education, member recruitment, or hiring appropriate consultants.

## **Clearly identify the mutual needs and ex­pectations that a coop could address and establish group expectations.**
- **Shared objectives:**  Develop clear group objectives to avoid misunderstandings or failures. These objectives might include job satisfaction, maximum income, or reason­ able income along with secondary objec­tives; the development and marketing of a product, the growth of an enterprise or in­dustry, spreading cooperative principles, or creating a socially or environmentally re­sponsible workplace.
- **Expected level of income:** Draft an ex­plicit statement of the minimum income level and other related benefits each mem­ber expects. This is important in selecting a business idea and in conducting the fea­sibility study and developing the business plan necessary in determining whether the enterprise is feasible.
- **Ownership and capital structures:** Dis­cuss the legal issues and capital structure to determine if a cooperative is the best way to meet group objectives. Although the de­tails of incorporation and capital are deter­mined at a later stage, members can reach general agreement on this topic before the bylaws and membership agreements are completed.
- **How profits get dispersed:** It is impor­tant to agree on any pay differentials among workers with varying skill levels. If pay differentials are agreed to, discuss the criteria that will be used to establish varying wages. Agreement should also be reached on whether managers will be utilized, whether they will paid more than other workers, and, if so, what the ratio should be between the two groups.
- **Business product(s) or service(s):** Iden­tify a business product or service idea from the start.
