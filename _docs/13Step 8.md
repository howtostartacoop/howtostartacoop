# **Start operations. Implement the business plan.**
Begin operations.

## Guidelines
Once the co-op is incorporated, has approved its bylaws and basic rules, hired or appointed a manager, acquired the necessary finances, and obtained suitable premises, it is ready to begin operations. The first task of management and worker-owners is to implement the co­-op's business plan.· Aside from operational matters, management will:

**Develop Community Recognition**
- Publicize the worker co-op's opening in the
appropriate media to create name recognition and a positive image in target markets.

**Establish and maintain ongoing member .communication about co-op performance.**
Effective communication, participation, and decision making are critical to co-op success.
- Establish procedures or systems to keep
members informed of progress and prob­lems, and ensure ongoing communication among worker-members, as well as among workers, managers, and the board.

**Establish and maintain good relation­ ships with customers and suppliers.**
- Conduct periodic customer surveys to make sure the co-op is meeting its custom­ers' needs and expectations along with achieving its business objectives.

**Implement the education and training plan.**
Because education is critical to the suc­cess of a worker-co-op, regular education and training to improve the business, communi­cation, and cooperative skills of the worker­ members should begin as soon as possible­ even before start-up-and continue regularly.

**Hold a planning session or retreat.**
Once operations have been underway for 6 to 9 months, hold an intense planning session or retreat for the board and management (or for the entire cooperative-if the membership is not too large) to discuss how things are going and where to go next.
- Establish short- (1 year) and medium-term (5 year) business goals. The co-ops ongo­ing success depends on constant vigilance to effective worker participation, good busi­ness practices, good customer relations, and anticipating changes in the marketplace.
- Review results of education and training or the co-ops board, management, and work­ers and modify where needed.
