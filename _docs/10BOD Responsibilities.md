# **Basic Responsibilities of the Worker Co-op Board of directors**
The board of directors is elected by the worker-owners. When a co-op chooses to operate without an elected board, each cooperative member should be designated as a director. The primary responsibility of the board of directors is to ensure that the best interests of the corporation the cooperative) and its owners (the workers) are protected. The board is responsible for the co op's actions and compliance with regulations.  
The fundamental legal standard for every director is to act in good faith, in a manner he or she believes to be in the best interests of the co-op, and with such care as an ordinary prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances.  
The board is to meet at regular intervals monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly. Where applicable, officers (president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer) are elected to organize the work and to assist in the board's internal operations. Effective boards obtain training and help as soon as possible and pursue ongoing training and educational programs to help them understand and effectively fulfill their responsibilities.

## **The Board has Three Primary Responsibilities**
- **To act as trustees on behalf of the worker-members.** The board does this by establishing mechanisms for member input, by carefully monitoring the coop's financial status, by hiring auditors to review the financial records, by making regular reports on the status of the co op to the members, and by making sure that the co-op follows its bylaws, policies, and appropriate regulations.
- **To ensure the sound management of the co-op.** The board is responsible for selecting and supervising the co op's management. It does so by reviewing management reports and monitoring key indicators (such as inventory turnover, cost of operations, sales trends, or other financial ratios) and evaluating management performance.
- **To set long-range goals and plan for the co-op's future.** The board does this by participating in strategic planning discussions with the membership and managers by approving yearly and long range plans, and by setting performance goals.

## **A special note on the importance of clear board and management roles:**
The co op board of directors plays a key role in the success of the organization and S accountable to the worker-owners. The worker-owners elect the board. The board selects
management from among the members. In some cases, particularly in large cooperatives, the board may hire outside management. Management is accountable to the board. Management establishes
and oversees administration of the co-op's affairs in accordance with the cooperative's bylaws, carries out the goals and objectives set by the board of directors and members, and supervises worker owners, as needed.
