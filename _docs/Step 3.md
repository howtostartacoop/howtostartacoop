# **Conduct a Feasibility Study; Present Findings. Obtain a Commitment to Proceed.**
In this step, we will determine if the proposed worker co-op is likely to succeed and benefit the worker-owners by assessing the feasibility of the business idea: potential customers, markets and
expected volume of business, needed equipment and facilities, estimated operating costs, capitalization, and financing options.

## **Guidelines**
## **Conduct Preliminary Market Research and Analysis.**
Assign tasks to individuals or subcommittees. Obtain outside professional assistance if available and needed. Market research and analysis identifies potential markets, discerns the potential market niche, and defines the operational technicalities such as how to manufacture and distribute products or services. Research may vary depending on the business area. The basic questions are: "Can it be produced?" and "Will it sell?"
- Visit similar worker co-ops in the area and
talk with key individuals from worker co­
ops in other regions.
- Find out about other businesses in your industry, whether co-op or not, and how they operate.
- Conduct a market survey of potential cus­tomers and suppliers.

## **Consider Experience and Skill Needs.**
Mem­bers of the organizing group must have the necessary interpersonal skills and commitment to be effective participants in a business fea­turing democratic decision making and gov­ernance. They must be willing to work coop­eratively and actively participate in self-gov­ernance. Finally, they must have the necessary business skills to operate and manage the pro­ posed business and the necessary technical skills to manufacture the product or provide the service.
- Inventory the skills of the organizing group and compare them with the skills needed for the proposed business.
- If the group lacks some skills and exper­tise, determine how they can be developed or obtained.

## **Identify Special Equipment, Facilities, or Licensing Required.**
Note any requirements the government may impose on the business, and list the types of equipment and facilities required to operate the business. These must be readily available or accessible.
- Compile a list of permits needed (includ­ing business licenses), equipment and fa­cilities to be acquired, and tasks to be ac­complished. Approximate the costs or lead time required to obtain them.

## **Calculate the Costs of Doing Business and Prepare Financial Projections.**
The initial fi­nancial projections and other findings must make sense and justify starting a worker co­ op. When calculating start-up costs, include rent, payroll, insurance, equipment, utilities, raw materials, advertising, and other business expenses. Establish a price for the product or service and answer the following questions: Is the price at or below the competition? Would the product or service sell at that price? Can the business make a profit if it sells the prod­uct or service at the proposed price?

## **Make Comparisons and Evaluate Compe­tition.**
Using the above answers, compare your proposed business with other businesses in the same industry. Costs of production, product prices, anticipated revenues, size of workforce and management, and organization of busi­ness operations all need to be compared to similar characteristics of other businesses in the industry.
- Talk to bank or trade association representatives, or, if possible, workers at other firms to learn about typical businesses in the in­dustry, or what the prospects are. Use pub­ lic sources of information to get data on the firm or industry

## **Explore Sources of Funding.**
Starting a worker co-op requires secure financing; ex­plore all sources of funding to finance the start­ up. Determine the funds needed to start and operate the enterprise. Consider if members could contribute "sweat equity" in addition to cash as part of their initial investment.
- There are two primary ways to compete
successfully: offer a lower price than the competition, and offer a better (or differ­entiated) product or service. The second approach is often more realistic for small businesses.
- Investigate and identify possible sources of capital funding--membership capital as well as loans from banks and other lend­ers, or possibly grants.
- Investigate alternative funding sources such as special start-up financing, economic­ development money for job creation and community revitalization, and self-employ­ment or small-business loans available to firms in certain locations.

## **Utilize Professional Assistance**
It is often necessary and beneficial to hire consultants or experts to help complete the feasibility study, write the business plan, or start a business.
- Obtain help from outside experts and con­sultants experienced in starting new busi­nesses and new worker co-ops. Check with your regional cooperative development center, university business school, Small Business Development Center, county ex­tension office, state and local economic­ development agencies, chamber of com­merce, and related groups for technical re­ sources and experts. Additional sources of assistance range from fellow workers, sup­ pliers, customers, and other businesses and co-ops, to libraries, trade associations, and colleges and universities.

## **Prepare a Written Report**
Compile and ana­lyze the information collected. Outside experts and consultants can be invaluable in verifying the accuracy of your research.

## **Meet to Discuss the Report and Findings**
- Encourage full discussion by all partici­pants.
- After presenting the feasibility study and steering committees recommendations, al­ low point-by-point discussions. Several meetings may be necessary to cover the en­ tire report.
- Participants may request further research or changes in the report.
- Following in-depth discussion, vote on whether to proceed.
