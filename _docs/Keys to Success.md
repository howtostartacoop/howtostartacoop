# **Keys to Success**
Each cooperative has unique aspects and faces different start-up challenges. However, there are common areas critical to the future suc­cess of the enterprise. Studies show the main reasons that new businesses fail are insuffi­cient financing and lack of business expertise. In addition, worker co-ops that fail do so most often because they lack:
- Shared objectives;
- An effective system for worker participa­tion in decision making; or
- Suitable ownership and equity structures.  

By paying careful attention to these areas you can avoid many of the problems that shut down new businesses. The following are some key areas, learned from past worker-coopera­tive successes and failures, that help to en­ sure the success of a new worker cooperative.

**1. Clearly Defined Purpose and Focus**
When a co-op's purpose is clear and under­ stood by everyone involved, it is much easier to define the path (business plan) and achieve stated goals.  
To succeed, the co-op must begin with a vi­ able business idea and a specific focus, such as producing a particular product or service. Equally important, members must share the same objectives.

**2. Feasible Business Idea and Thorough Business Plan**
All new businesses involve risk. The purpose of the business plan is to minimize the risk and maximize the chances of success through careful research and planning.  
The business plan of a worker co-op should be so accurate and comprehensive that people feel secure investing large amounts of their own money. If the members do not have enough confidence in the plan to invest their own money, no banker will.

**3. Suitable Ownership and Equity Struc­tures**
There are several ownership and equity struc­tures that can be used in the organization of a worker cooperative. Select ownership and eq­uity structures that help to build a strong capi­tal base for the enterprise and a positive fi­nancial incentive system for the cooperative's members.

**4. Adequate Financing**
Co-op members are the key source of initial financing for the worker cooperative. Money is collected from the members through the sale of membership shares-the ownership certifi­cates of the cooperative. Equity capital sup­ plied by the members must be sufficient to provide enough collateral to leverage addi­tional debt financing from banks or other lend­ ing institutions, or economic-development agencies.
