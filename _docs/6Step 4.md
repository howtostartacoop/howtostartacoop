# **Prepare and review the business plan.**
In this step, we will define how the co-op will be structured and financed. Approve the business plan and ob­tain a firm commitment, including a financial commitment. Legally form the co-op.

## **Guidelines**
The successful co-op relies on a detailed and thorough business plan. The business plan serves two main purposes: 0) it is the blue­ print and basic guide for the members and managers when the co-op starts operations; and (2) it is the central document to any loan or other funding application.

## **Importance of the Business Plan**
- The business plan, a revised and expanded version of the feasibility study, outlines and defines every facet of the proposed co-op's potential business and operations-who will be involved, who the customers will be, how they will learn about the co-op's products and how the products will get to them, where the money will come from, and the operational costs
- Documenting your ideas and assumptions, projecting financial and operational figures, and pulling these elements together into one complete plan helps to minimize the risk of business failure. The plan will change over time to adapt to changes in the business environment.
- Verify the accuracy of the business plan by getting accurate and objective feedback from consultants and resource people ex­perienced in business start-ups and prepar­ing business plans.

## **Prepare the Report for Presentation to Potential Members**
- The organizing committee should prepare
a report (or supervise its preparation) that summarizes the findings of the business­ plan research. Attach the summary to the top of the business plan and distribute to potential members for review.
- End the report with recommendations of whether to proceed with the co-op.

## **Discuss the Business Plan with Potential Members; Obtain their Consent to Proceed**
- Review and discuss the business plan; make adjustments.
- Obtain the groups formal commitment to organize the co-op.
- Vote on whether to proceed.

## **Initiate Funding**
- Get definite financial commitments from
potential members to distinguish those committed to the co-op, and to generate money to pay for preparing the organizing documents. Observe state and federal securities laws.
- Prepare loan documents, as applicable, to seek additional funding from banks, lend­ ing agencies, economic-development agen­cies, and other sources.
