# **Hold the Co-op's first, or Charter, Meeting; Define and Accept Roles**
In this step we will formally begin the cooperative and accept the articles of incorporation and bylaws.

## Guidelines
## **The First Membership Meeting**
- The primary purpose is to approve legal documents and institutionalize the process of governing the new enterprise.
- This is also the first annual meeting. Most worker co-ops hold an annual membership meeting that typically considers financial reports, and reviews, discusses, and votes on proposed policies.
- Minutes should record what transpired.

## **Decision-making Process and Election of Board of Directors**
- Members may decide to jointly manage their business as a collective without a for­mal board of directors and hired manager. In this case, the owners should discuss, develop, and approve bylaws and operat­ing procedures that explain the co-op's gov­ernance and decision-making structures. If the co-op is incorporated the need for a board of directors can be met by making every member a director. In a collective managerial or other decisions are usually made by consensus. Indicate circumstances and conditions where majority voting may be appropriate and specify the majority necessary, such as 75%.
- If the worker cooperative is large, or the organizers prefer to choose the more con­ventional governance structure, they will need to elect a board of directors.

## **Review and Approve the Articles of Incorporation**
- Review the articles. Allow time for mem­bers to discuss any concerns or questions.
- Vote to approve the articles.

## **Adopt Bylaws**
- Review and discuss bylaws. Amend, if nec­essary, assuring that changes are legal.
- Vote to approve the bylaws.
- If a board of directors is elected, hold the first board meeting shortly after the char­ter meeting and elect officers-board presi­dent, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or other positions listed in the bylaws.

## **Convene the Business or Board Meeting**
- Select a financial institution; arrange for bookkeeping and the handling of finances.
- Clarify how roles are to be assigned and responsibilities fulfilled (e.g., preparing job descriptions, action plans, or work assign­ments); determine training needs, and ar­range for the training to be provided.
- Devise a plan to work with members to address all start-up matters as detailed in the business plan.
- If the co-op plans to hire or appoint a pro­fessional manager, the board establishes procedures to carry out the search or se­lection.
