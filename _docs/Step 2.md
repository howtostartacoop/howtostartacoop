# **Potential members meet to discuss needs and vision. Coordinate organizing and business research.**
In this step we will assess if enough interest in starting a worker co-op exists to justify further research and planning. We will also elect a steering committee to col­lect information and prepare detailed plans for organizing the new co-op.

## **Guidelines**
## **Hold an informational meeting for people interested in organizing a worker co-op.**
- Plan for an effective meeting
- Present initial research findings.
- Allow enough discussion time for people to ask questions and express their views. Be clear and specific about what a worker co-op can and cannot do, what is involved in the organizing process, and that the pro­ cess will take substantial time and work.
- Vote on whether to proceed.
- Funds are necessary for initial research and other organizing costs. Investing personal money or helping with fundraising are ex­cellent ways to test commitment to the co­ op. The group may decide to collect a speci­fied dollar amount from potential members.

## **Handling Funds**
Money should be deposited in a special bank account, placed in escrow, or managed in a manner that assures members of security and fiscal responsibility. Money may be collected from potential members, earned through fundraising activities, or procured through development loans or grants.

Make a plan for how unused development funds will be used if the co-op isn't formed. State laws may dictate restrictions, but options may include donation to a specified charity or nonprofit organization, or redistribution to specific contributors.

## **Establish a core decision-making group or select a steering committee.**
If the group is small or consensus decision making is utilized, all members function as the steering committee. The steering commit­ tee coordinates and oversees co-op develop­ment until a board of directors is elected. The committee may conduct the research itself, coordinate and oversee the work of others in­volved in the organizing process, or it may serve as a liaison between the members and outside consultants. The steering committee is responsible for:
- Surveying potential members about their level of interest in starting a worker co-op
- Overseeing selection of a business idea
- Collecting market and financial information
- Conducting a feasibility study
- Keeping potential members informed of the group's progress
- Coordinating organizational meetings
- Overseeing the preparation of a thorough business plan for the new worker co-op
