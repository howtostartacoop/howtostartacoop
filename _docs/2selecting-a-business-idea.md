# **Selecting a Business Idea**
Sometimes groups interested in starting a worker co-op know they want to form a worker cooperative, but are unsure about what business to pursue. Once the reasons for starting the worker co-op are identified and agreed upon, the group has 3 basis for looking for sound business ideas. This feature outlines the process for selecting a business.

## **Apply the Screening Process to all Potential Business Ideas**
The screening process to identify the most promising enterprises for worker co-op development consists
of: (1) listing possible business ideas; (2) collecting information and narrowing the list of
possibilities by evaluating, discussing, and conducting feasibility studies of the most promising ideas; and (3) selecting the business idea that best utilizes the prospective members interests and skills with the factors necessary for successful co-op development.

### **1. List the Possibilities**
- Inventory the group's skills and interests; brainstorm compatible business ideas. Seek ideas from fellow workers and respected sources.
- Look at the existing types of businesses in your community. Evaluate existing natural
and other resources. Are there any gaps or opportunities open to a new business?
- Observe existing businesses for ideas to help design the new business

### **2. Narrow the Possibilities**
- Identify and discuss the pros and cons to the business ideas
- Conduct feasibility studies of the most promising ideas

### **3. Selecting the Best Business Idea**
Clarify your group's objectives. Fully explore the compatibility between each business idea and your group's reasons for starting the co-op by answering the following questions. Would the proposed worker co-op:
- Meet the group's employment and income needs and other objectives?
- Secure the necessary resources to generate desired levels of employment and income?
- Provide needed goods and services?
- Utilize or expand the group's skill base?
- Provide links with existing businesses for new opportunities?
- Cause environmental or other problems for the employees or the community?

Assess the Business and Political Environments:
- Would the business have a steady, reliable market for its goods or services? IF so, would that market grow or stagnate over time?
- Would the organizing group be able and willing to provide the equity capital and workforce required to start and operate the business?
- Would the necessary capital investment require large debt financing? If so, would existing lenders or sources be willing to provide it?
- If the business failed, would the enterprise be saddled with a large debt, unused or unusable buildings and equipment, or unemployed worker-members?
- Would the business have or be able to obtain the special skills and licensing needed?
- How long will it take before the business breaks even, and can the business and members be financially sustained during this time?
- Would the business generate sufficient profits to recover the start-up costs and provide money for expansion and growth?
- Would the business provide good jobs and steady income for the worker-members?
