# **Implement Management. Prepare for Business Start-up**
In this step we will implement a management structure, such as a collective, teams, or general manager.

## Guidelines
Follow the steps set forth in the business plan; it is the blueprint for organizing the new busi­ness.

## **Selecting Management**
The selection of competent management is critical to the suc­cess of any new business start-up. If manage­ment has not already been identified or hired, do so before starting operations.  
If the co-op is small enough, and the members choose to operate as a collective, then the tra­ditional manager's role may be divided among the owners, according to ability, interest, or pledge to learn those divided duties.  
Manufacturing or service businesses that in­ tend to grow beyond 15 to 20 worker-mem­bers will probably need to seek an experienced manager from within or outside to help estab­lish and manage business operations.

## **Hiring a Manager**
If a manager is to be hired, a formal hiring process should be conducted. Select a manager who has the qualifications and skills to effectively manage business operations, whose management style is compatible with your cooperatives decision-making structure. Begin by clearly defining the manager's role, functions, and relationship to the board and other worker-members. Be certain that there is no ambiguity or misunderstanding about who has what authority and how the business is to be managed.
- Identify the knowledge, skills, and experience expected from your first manager.
- Prepare a job description that clearly speci­fies responsibilities. Estab­lish specific goals for the manager during the first year.
- If applicable, advertise the position as widely as possible. Many trade magazines require substantial notice before listing positions. Local papers and employment offices often list jobs very quickly. Depend­ ing on the skills and experience needed, you may want to engage a search firm. Use local contacts-economic-development agencies, chambers of commerce, business people, other worker co-ops-to publicize the position.
- Carefully screen all applicants. Check ref­erences and job experience.
- The right manager for start-up may not be the right person to manage the worker co­ op's long-term operations. Starting a new business requires special skills. As you search for potential worker co-op manag­ers, consider looking for managers with start-up experience.
- Early management responsibilities include communicating with members, research­ ing facilities and equipment, marketing or sales efforts, and making arrangements to begin the co-op's operations.

## **Secure financing and finalize agreements from all sources**
Members, grants, loans, purchases, and rentals.
- If some members have not paid their capi­tal contributions, follow up on their com­mitment.
- Use the business plan to seek additional debt capital to start the business.
- Explore all possible economic-development funds for job creation or community revi­talization.

## **Acquire facilities and necessary licenses and permits.**
- Enter into the necessary agreements to rent
or purchase business premises or produc­tion facilities.
- Obtain the business and other permits needed to operate the business.
- Obtain bids and purchase the equipment and raw materials to produce the products or services.
