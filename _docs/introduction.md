# Introduction

## What is a cooperative?
The International Co-Operative Alliance defines a cooperative, as “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise.” Cooperatives are owned democratically by their members, with one vote for each to decide the board of directors.

## What are some different types of cooperatives?
- Worker cooperatives: Organizations managed by the people who work there
- Consumer cooperatives: Businesses owned and managed by the people who use their services
- Multi stakeholder or Hybrid cooperatives: Organizations that share ownership between different stakeholder groups  

This site will mainly focus on worker cooperatives.

## Why worker cooperatives?
Worker cooperatives play a critical role in building wealth in communities since they create quality, empowering jobs for community members. Because most workers work in their community, worker cooperatives are more likely than other businesses to employ sustainable business practices that don't harm the local environment, and profits are more likely to remain and circulate in the community. Worker cooperatives also allow workers to build wealth through owning shares in the cooperative.
